# Spatial Incubator

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

The idea is to input image data associated with interior spaces, starting with office interiors, then expanding to residentail and public space, and using semi-supervised learning, classify that data according to survey data including productivity, inhabitant wellness, happiness and general satisfaction, to be able to generate novel spaces based on a new designer's input and environmental criteria, such as floor area, environment, and jurisdictional regulations. The tool would generate both layout and material suggestions.


## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

* Many design projects begin with too little data, this would create an informed starting point for further development.
* Design work relies on individual knowledge, making it difficult to build on innovative ideas that rely on singular personalities.
* Many people are dissatified with the spaces they inhabit, leading to lower level of both individual happiness and productivity.
* Subjective data is difficult to quantify. Machine learning can empower designers to use that data in more impactful ways.


## How is it used?

Semi-supervised learning to classify image data (plan and photograph) according to subjective data. Extract common layout, material, lighting and space use.
